Slug: about

My name is Pawel Ngei (previously Pawel Chojnacki). I'm a full-stack web developer, cybersecurity educator, open science and free software activist and a former [Warsaw Hackerspace] facilitator.

I freelance as ALXD [(registry index)](https://prod.ceidg.gov.pl/CEIDG/CEIDG.Public.UI/SearchDetails.aspx?Id=d9303664-0fe2-4dc0-aecb-797877c2d1ba) and with the awesome [X-Team](http://x-team.com/). You can also check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-ngei-19227983/) profile.

I highly value rationalist and humanist values and consider myself a critical [transhumanist]. I seek to live by these ideals, changing world around me bit by bit, day by day.

I have a background in basic mathematics, physics, neurobiology and computational neuroscience. I program mainly in Python and JavaScript and have experience in Linux systems administration. I am a [certified](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=1&t=c&d=2017-06-09&ci=AWS00266997&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BR0CGMz91Rwua01IfJn9Esg%3D%3D) AWS Solutions Architect Associate.

My current biggest project is [Glider Ink](https://glider.ink/), a graphic novel about hackerspaces and different approaches to hacking. I'm its producer and main writer, hellbent on publishing it on Creative Commons.

You can contact me through my [email] and [Mastodon]. You can be also interested in my [github] account, although I'm not developing anything worthwhile at the moment.
