When overwhelmed by the stupidity, ignorance and despair around me, I like going back to these just to regain some hope in humanity:

### Solarpunk

A Solarpunk [Manifesto](http://www.re-des.org/a-solarpunk-manifesto/) summing up all the values of the movement. Focusing on hope and finding solutions instead of warnings.

### Hackerspaces

#### [Gemsi - Our Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJpsNQF60Fc)

5-minute video of the beginning of Hackerspace and Makerspace movement in the Middle East, narrated by awesome [Bilal Ghalib - sudo make hope](http://bilalghalib.com/). The whole movement inspires me with their irresistibility - even after having their hackerspace [bulldozed by the government](http://hackaday.com/2016/05/08/running-a-hackerspace-is-hard-egypt-edition/) Tarek Omar and other people [continue to educate and encourage](http://hackaday.com/2016/10/22/hackenings-burbank-and-cairo/) people all around Egypt.

#### [Mitch Altman on Hackerspace Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkiX7R1-kaY)

20-minute video of Mitch Altman sharing his stories and ideas from hackerspaces in Germany and USA. Spiritual father of many communities around the world doesn't want to be a bearded sage in an ivory tower - he's out there, hacking and having fun with other people!

#### [How open source and local hackers helped stop Ebola epidemic](https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7561-how_open_source_software_second_hand_laptops_and_hackers_helped_stop_ebola_and_stopped_an_apocalypse)

During the Ebola epidemic in 2014 Sierra Leone was crippled as a country. There was no management system existing to coordinate all the doctors and international aid workers, the salaries haven't been paid for months, the riots were just starting. Several self-taught hackers took a little over a month to develop an open ERP system and a mobile banking platform which saved the country.

### Sheer wonder of the world

#### [Pale Blue Dot](https://youtu.be/p86BPM1GV8M)

A beautiful spiritual description of Earth and our civilization by Carl Sagan from [his book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot_%28book%29) of the same title.

#### [The Future is Ours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDiUVS_-4_Q)

Very transhumanist, optimistic short on the world around us.
