Last month gave my "Technological Narratives: Solarpunk, Cyberpunk, Popculture" talk at HOPE2020 conference. It's finally available in video form! You can watch it at [this link](https://livestream.com/internetsociety3/hope2020/videos/209149752)!

[HOPE](https://hope.net/) stands for Hackers On Planet Earth, a US hacker conference organized by [2600](https://2600.com/) magazine, The Hacker Quarterly. Normally it happens in the New York, but due to the pandemic situation this year it was moved online. The conference featured dozens of great talks and workshops across 9 days, including speakers such as Cory Doctorow or Idalin Bob√© from TechActivist.Org.
